# Trader Sentiment Analysis

This project explores the relationship between market sentiment and trader behavior using real-world trade and sentiment data. The goal is to understand whether traders tend to buy at higher prices during “Greed” and lower during “Fear” conditions.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Merge trade execution data with sentiment data by timestamp
- Clean and format timestamps for alignment
- Visualize how execution prices vary with sentiment
- Derive insights into behavioral trading patterns

## 📊 Key Insight

Trades were executed at **higher prices during Greed**, and **lower prices during Fear**, showing strong sentiment influence on trading behavior.
